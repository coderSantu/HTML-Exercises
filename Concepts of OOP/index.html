            <li><b>Object: </b>OOP is based on the idea of creating objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.</li>
            <li><b>Class:</b> Classes are templates or blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties and behavior of objects that belong to them.</li>
            <li><b>Inheritance: </b> Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and behavior of the existing class, which can be extended or overridden as needed.</li>
            <li><b>Polymorphism:</b>Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different types to be treated as if they are of the same type. It allows for flexibility and reusability of code.</li>
            <li><b>Encapsulation: </b> Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world, and exposing only the necessary functionality through a public interface. This helps to ensure that changes to the internal implementation of an object do not affect the external code that uses it.</li>
            <li><b>Abstraction: </b> Abstraction is the process of focusing on the essential features of an object, while ignoring the details that are not relevant to its current context. It allows for more efficient and effective programming by simplifying complex systems.</li>
