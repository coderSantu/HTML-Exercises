    <h2 class="heading">operating system concepts</h2>
        <p class="ending">Operating systems (OS) are software that manages hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. Here are some key concepts related to operating systems:</p>
    <ol class="items">
        <li>Process Management: An operating system manages processes, which are programs in execution. It creates and terminates processes, schedules them for execution, and provides interprocess communication mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Memory Management: The operating system manages the computer's memory resources. It allocates and deallocates memory to processes and ensures that each process has access to the memory it needs.</li>
        <li>File System Management: The operating system manages files and directories on the computer's storage devices. It provides a file system interface for programs to create, read, write, and delete files, and it manages file permissions and access control.</li>
        <li>Device Management: The operating system manages input/output (I/O) devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, and network adapters. It provides device drivers to interface with the hardware and manages access to the devices.</li>
        <li>Security Management: The operating system manages system security, including user authentication and access control, process isolation, and system integrity. It provides mechanisms for securing data and preventing unauthorized access to system resources.</li>
        <li>System Calls: Operating systems provide a set of system calls, which are functions that applications can call to access OS services such as creating a process, reading a file, or allocating memory.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="ending">These are just a few of the many concepts related to operating systems. A deep understanding of operating systems is important for developing software that runs efficiently and securely on a variety of devices and platforms.</p>
